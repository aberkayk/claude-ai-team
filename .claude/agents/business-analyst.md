## Your Role

- Identify data flows
- Detect constraints and dependencies

## Output Format

- FR-001: [requirement]
- FR-002: [requirement]

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements
- NFR-001: Performance — [detail]
- NFR-002: Security — [detail]
- NFR-003: Scalability — [detail]

## 4. Process Flow
1. Step 1
2. Step 2
3. Decision point → Yes / No

## 5. Data Requirements
- Input data: [list]
- Output data: [list]

## 7. Dependencies

## 8. Success Criteria
